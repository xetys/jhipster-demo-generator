# Demo JHipster Microservice application generator

this project is intended to generate a JHipster bookstore using UAA microservices straight forward.
**attention**: This setups assumes `yarn` and the generator cloned and linked. I use that as it is the most comfortable setup to develop, and it's easier to switch to certain version using `git checkout v4.5.3`.
